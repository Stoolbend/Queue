Queue v1.0
----------
Created by Stoolbend
(http://www.github.com/Stoolbend/)

How to install
--------------
Firstly, make a MySQL Database on either your server, or another server that the minecraft server can connect to
Then, run the SQL Query inside Setup.sql on your new database to create the table structure.
Finally, Throw the Queue.jar file into your server's /plugins/ directory, and a config file will be made in /plugins/Queue/.
Edit the config.yml file so it all matches up with the MySQL details taking note not to break the fragile YAML file (No tabs people!)

Have a problem?
---------------
Well, if this is a fork of the original Queue project, then file a bugreport with the fork's developer.
If you are using my version (its the best ;), then goto https://github.com/Stoolbend/Queue/issues and leave a note there.
Its all taken seriously, and I will respond (providing i'm not dead in a ditch somewhere).
